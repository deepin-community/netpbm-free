This file has the usage to remind the maintainer what he should do.
You don't need to read this file if you extracted tagged code out of
alioth: The warnings below don't apply then.

Warning. This is work in progress. Use it only if the progression bar is
on a useable state. The total goal is to take the debian package to current
without loosing the security fixes and the code audits. And: Be warned that
some programs may not be DFSG-free. This will be fixed before release.

  Get to 9.25
=>Get to 10.0
    Include the trivial patch parts (means: some patches are applied only half)
    Include the not-so-trivial patch parts
    Make the legacy links
    Make sure the package is DFSG-free
    Make sure the package is compileable and other final polishing
  Get to 10.<current>

Small todo:
- #142579 if I get a patch (as I have asked)


Recheck:
- pnm/pnmnorm
- pnm/pamstretch-gen
- pnm/pnmcolormap
- pnm/pnmpad (overflow_add)
- is it ok to move bitio.c to libpbm? Yes, because ppm always includes pbm.
- picttoppm.1
  +> file was dropped in stable because "error unfixable ..." Why?


Todo:
- who owns / License  ppmfade -> contributed to pd
    -> mistake wrote in orig file according to Bryan, waiting for explicit ok
- Make system is really broken -> make don't stop on errors!!
- review the tmpfile-patches
- repair ppmquantall
- why has ppmtompeg different output if using parallel?

Left over from 10.0:
Add pamendian. [BH]
Add pamtohdiff, hdifftopam. [BH]
ppmqvga: remove; appears to be obsoleted by Pnmquant. [BH]
ppmtouil: rename to pamtouil, add transparency. [BH]
Export now pm_canonstr, pm_openColornameFile, pm_colorget, pm_rgbnorm,
  pnm_scalesample, pnm_setpamrow and pam_colorname.
  manpages for that! 
  


- bitio.h???

./ppm/ppmtompeg/iframe.c:
  sprintf(fileName, "%s.decoded.%d", outputFileName ... is ugly
./ppm/ppmtompeg/parallel.c: fixed.
./ppm/ppmtorgb3.c: Write warning in manual page
./pnm/fiasco/lib/bit-io.c: writes anywhere in the path. Ok?
./ppm/ppmfade
./pnm/pnmquant: Don't use "UNLINK => $TRUE"!

remove buildtools/libopt

(c)  of pnmendian?
move libpnm4.c -> rast.c ?
..pcdindex? /pcdovtoppm
