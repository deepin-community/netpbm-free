Installing shhopt
=================

If you don't have gcc, you'll have to edit the Makefile. If your
compiler is not ANSI, you'll have to change all files.

  1. Check the Makefile

  2. Build the library

	make dep
	make

  3. Install library and header file

	make install

By default, the library will be installed in /usr/local/lib, and the
header file in /usr/local/include.

If you run Linux with ELF, you may want to make a shared
library. Check out the Makefile.
