<h1>Using netpbm from 
<a href="http://netpbm.alioth.debian.org/">http://netpbm.alioth.debian.org/</a> outside Debian</h1>

<p>This package is free software, so you can of course also use it outside
Debian. We are pleased if you like this package, and are willing to change
it to make it fit better. But: We can't do any
testing outside of Debian's current releases. And: In the way this package
is constructed there are some manifestations of Debian's way of treating
code. We try to document them in this file. If you need changes for better
inclusion of this package in your favourite OS, please supply us with the
details and, if possible, code. We would do what we can, as long as we don't
breach Debian's rules or make things to complicated.</p>



<p>Assumptations of installed build helpers:</p>

<p>We assume that you have a working base system, means: All essential and 
build-essential packages are there. Among these, there are (this are the
names used in Debian):</p>
<ul>
<li>  libc6-dev</li>
<li>  gcc</li>
<li>  make</li>
<li>  bash</li>
<li>  bsdutils</li>
<li>  coreutils</li>
<li>  diff</li>
<li>  findutils</li>
<li>  grep</li>
<li>  gzip</li>
<li>  perl-base</li>
<li>  sed</li>
<li>  tar</li>
<li>  util-linux</li>
</ul>

<p>We also assume that "install" is capable of creating directories and
removing files that are at the to-be-installed location. We assume that
the Makefiles don't need to handle old versions of files, but we have a
package management system that removes them if needed. So we don't provide
an uninstall. We assume that the target system is capable of using shared
libraries, so we don't need a "merge" target.</p>

<p>If we broke your favourite OS, we're sorry about this. We are willing to
add code for unbreaking, but you have to supply details to us. Code would
make un-breaking even faster.</p>



<h2>Free software and copyright</h2>

<p>This package will remain to consist to 100% of free software. Free software
is used in Debian consistent to the Debian Free Software Guidlines (DFSG),
as defined in <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines</a>.
See debian/copyright for a detailed list of copyright attached to each
programm.</p>

<p>However, the clause above is only strict valid for version of the cvs branch
tagged by us, and only to our best knowledge.
Checkout to other times may have also code where we are very
confident that it is free, but we don't have all license issues finally
settled. (You can assume that we don't like to make the work of adding code,
just to remove it later because of failing the DFSG. So be confident that
it's normally just a missing e-mail in these cases.) Non-tagged cvs-code can
also be failing in every other aspect, be uncompilable or similar things.</p>

<p>And: The clause just says that we are quite confident and we don't know of
anything opposing this. But there can always be e.g. a patent unknown to
us. If you notice such an error, please alert us (best via the Debian Bug
Tracking System, <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/">http://bugs.debian.org/</a>).
If you notice a violation again
the "free software"-clause, a severity of serious is adaequate.</p>

<p>We don't change tagged versions after listing the tag on the web site.
So, if we notice an error, we'll correct this in cvs and release (and
tag) a new version as soon as possible. So, you should use only the
latest tagged version for your own safety.</p>



<h2>Bug Tracking</h2>

<p>If you notice an error, please check first with your distribution whether
this is an distribution-specific problem, and try to check a newer tagged
version of the cvs code. If you are sure that you found an error in the cvs
version, you can use the Debian Bug Tracking System via
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/">http://bugs.debian.org/</a>.
Please say in this case that you're using an
version exported from the cvs, and give the tag you used to retrive the
code to the BTS as version. And pre-check that this bug is not already
listed on 
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/src:netpbm-free">http://bugs.debian.org/src:netpbm-free</a>.</p>

<p>However, you should assume that only the versions of this package work that
are tagged by us and that have their tagged listed on the website. We would
look also at other bug reports, but we might just close such a bug with the
notice that you should test the newest tagged version.</p>


<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>The changes to this package are documented in HISTORY and in debian/changelog.
We try to keep common changes in HISTORY, but we don't always achieve this,
so you should look at both files.</p>
